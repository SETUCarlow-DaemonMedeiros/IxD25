      <h2>User Task - Tracking Progress / Targets and Goals</h2>
      <body>The user will be able to check how many regional plants they are 
      able to identify using the camera on their phone. There can be a reward for marking the 
      location of invasive plants, and a goal to identify a certain amount of plants within a certain time. 
      Upon reaching a goal, the player is awarded a badge and placed on a leaderboard. Enough badges
      grants the player further rewards.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <body>Here you can see the process of moving from the landing screen to adding a identified plant 
        to the user's collection. After logging in the user may view the current collection 
        directly by selecting the 'Collection' button in the main interaction menu, but in order
        to add to it, the user must first take a photo of a plant. The user clicks the camera icon 
        and is presented with their camera's view with a framing square. Once the plant is in focus,
        the camera button is pressed again to capture a photo. If the app is able to identify the plant, a new screen
        appears displaying information about the plant along with the photo the user took. They are given the option
        to add it to the collection. If they select this option, they are brought to the collection screen 
        and are able to view the new item next to the other items in the collection.
