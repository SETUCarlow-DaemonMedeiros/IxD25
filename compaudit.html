                sound and animation to capture the user's
                attention? Does it have a good balance of
                challenge and reward?</td>
              <td class="yellow">Visually, there is not much going on. Minimal eye catching colors
                or images likely for the purpose of keeping the user's attention
                primarily on the instructional videos, while keeping in line with the company's
                logo coloration. <br>

              <td class="red">Once you input a few user details on a basic menu, the app brings you to a 
                very colorful main menu. The layout is a little off and the color pallete is very
                inconsistent. There is challenge, but no more reward than a school test. <br>

                it is very easy to understand what each button or tab is for. This app uses sound
                recorded by the user to identify birds and then present facts about those birds to the user. <br>

                and recommendations to help users improve their 
                performance? Does it use data to personalize the 
                learning experience?</td>
              <td class="red">The app keeps track of a user's progress by remembering how many
                videos in a course the user has already viewed. There is a single representation
                of a reward which is a certification that may be applied to the user's cv/resume.<br>

              <td class="green">The app keeps good track of your progress, recording previous test attempts
                for perusal. During the practice mode, an explanation for the currect answer is provided
                to the user regardless of whether they answer a question wrong or right, and this explanation
                can be accessed at any point outside of a official style test. It does give the user the option 
                to view questions that they have seen the least, which is a slight bit of personalization for the user.<br>

                Users may personalize what they are shown further with options to display latin/scientific names, download
                info on birds from particular regions to utilize, and to even filter out particular sounds from their

                    Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
                <td class="yellow">The app is very easy to navigate with large buttons and large text.
                    You can see a visual representation of your position within the various categories.
                    There is a large search bar at the top of the screen as well, but it does not offer
                    active suggestions when typing. There is a small dropdown menu to the left of this as well.<br>

                <td class="yellow">Navigation is fairly basic. Category options are provided as simple lists
                    separated by headers for classification. There are many screens to select, but each screen is not
                    cluttered with information which is a relief after the main home screen.<br>

                    Its interface is clear visually, and simple to use. The main 
                    page provides three large buttons: 1. App use instructions,
                    2. Record sound, 3. Take a photo. The user has access to these buttons
                    immedately, and is able to use the main functionality of this app without
                    changing any other settings.
