    <h1> Introduction </h1>

      Welcome to the introduction of my Interaction Design Project. 
      The focus of this project will be the gamification of a learning app, 
      with the end goal of making its learning experience more engaging and interactive for the user. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education. 
      The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment.
      <br>
      <br>
      This project involves various phases, including competetive analyisis, wireframing, protoyping, and usability testing. 
      The competetive analysis helps me to identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlight areas that can be improved.
      <br>
      <br>
      Wireframing and protoyping allowed us to design and develop the interface
      and user experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from user's on the app's usability and functionality.
      The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.
      <br>
      <br>
      Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes.
